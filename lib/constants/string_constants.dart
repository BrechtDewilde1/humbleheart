We have built a warm home, not only for the seniors in our community but also for the children and students needing help. Helping others makes me happy, it’s my purpose in life! I’m coordinating the different projects and go on the road on a day-to-day basis. I will be on the project sites, together with the volunteers. And I’m always in for a joke, laughing all day 🙂";

When doing an internship in a slum village, I felt the urge to make a difference for the community. I want people to live a pain-free life, everybody with a smile on his face 🙂 Together with my husband and children, we take care of the needy people in our community. I belief it is not only important for myself, but also for the personal development of our children to learn how to share with and care for others. After the birth of our second son, I’m mainly supporting Humbleheart “in the backoffice”. I’m in charge of managing our house, making sure it’s a warm home for the volunteers. Together with Rasa I clean, cook and coordinate the practical stuff for the volunteers. In my free time I like to play volleybal and spending time with the seniors in our community!";
