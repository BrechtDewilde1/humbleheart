# Humbleheart

The repo of the Humbleheart website. This project is build during my time I was volunteering in Nepal. Humbleheart is an organization founded by Prakash, a generous individual living in the rural Meghauli Nepalese village. The goal of the Humbleheart project is to find volunteers from all over the world that are willing to assist Prakash in delivering basic needs to those in need in Meghauli.

## About the website

The website is built using the Flutter framework. It was designed to be intuitive, engaging, and easy to navigate for users of all skill levels. Firebase was used as hosting service. By leveraging Firebase, the Humbleheart website can handle traffic spikes and ensure the website remains available to users at all times.

## How You Can Help

Humbleheart is always looking for volunteers who are willing to lend their time, skills, and resources to the project. If you are interested in volunteering, please use the contact form on the website.

In addition to volunteering, you can also help by making a donation to the project. All donations go directly to supporting the work that Prakash is doing in Meghauli.
